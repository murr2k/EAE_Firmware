# Session Checkpoint - EAE Firmware Project

**Date**: July 31, 2025
**Project Status**: COMPLETE - Submitted to employer

## Project Summary
Successfully completed EAE Firmware Challenge implementing:
- Question 7: Cooling control logic (Python & C++)
- Question 7.1: All 8 advanced features
- CI/CD pipeline with Slack notifications
- Comprehensive documentation
- 2 releases (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)

## Key Achievements
- Working submission zip: `EAE_Firmware_Submission_MurrayKopit.zip`
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/murr2k/EAE_Firmware
- Wiki documentation on advanced control methods
- 80% CI/CD success rate after fixes
- Professional repository with badges, issues, releases

## Current State
- Main branch: Stable, complete submission
- CI/CD: Optimized with path filters (no builds on README changes)
- Documentation: Moved to GitHub Wiki
- Slack notifications: Configured and working

## Future Plans (After 1 Week)
Consider creating development branch for:
- Advanced control system demo
- AI-driven control implementation
- Experiments with methods from wiki

## Important Notes
- Ubuntu 20.04 removed from CI matrix (queue issues)
- Coverage at 45.3% (acceptable for demo)
- 8 open feature request issues
- Slack webhook configured in GitHub secrets

## Techniques Learned
Documented in `.claude/project_techniques.md`:
- CI/CD platform quirks and solutions
- Slack notification strategies
- Documentation layering
- Git workflow patterns
- Build system best practices

## Next Session Action Items
1. Wait one week before additional development
2. If proceeding, create development branch with clear README
3. Frame as post-submission experimentation
4. Implement advanced control demo from wiki concepts
