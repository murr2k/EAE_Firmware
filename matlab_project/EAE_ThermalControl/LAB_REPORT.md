## Executive Summary

This laboratory experiment investigates the design, tuning, and optimization of a PID controller for an automotive cooling system using MATLAB/Simulink. The study employs classical Ziegler-Nichols tuning methods followed by modern optimization algorithms to determine optimal controller parameters. Results demonstrate a significant discrepancy between theoretical predictions and practical implementation, with the model's inherent time constants preventing achievement of aggressive performance specifications.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 PID Control Theory

The PID controller implements the control law:

```
u(t) = Kp·e(t) + Ki·∫e(t)dt + Kd·de(t)/dt
```

Where:
- **u(t)** = control output (fan speed, 0-100%)
- **e(t)** = error signal (setpoint - measured temperature)
- **Kp** = proportional gain (immediate response)
- **Ki** = integral gain (steady-state error elimination)
- **Kd** = derivative gain (predictive damping)

### 2.2 Thermal System Dynamics

The cooling system is modeled as cascaded first-order systems with time delay:

```
G(s) = K·e^(-Ls) / [(τ₁s + 1)(τ₂s + 1)]
```

Parameters identified:
- **K** = 0.749 (static gain)
- **τ₁** = 150 seconds (engine thermal time constant)
- **τ₂** = 50 seconds (radiator time constant)
- **L** = 0.5 seconds (transport delay)

### 2.3 Ziegler-Nichols Tuning Methods

#### Reaction Curve Method (Open-Loop)
Based on step response tangent line:
- Kp = 1.2·T/(K·L)
- Ki = Kp/(2·L)
- Kd = Kp·0.5·L

#### Ultimate Gain Method (Closed-Loop)
Based on critical oscillation:
- Kp = 0.6·Kc
- Ki = 2·Kp/Pc
- Kd = Kp·Pc/8

Where Kc = critical gain, Pc = critical period

### 2.4 Performance Specifications

| Metric | Requirement | Definition |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Rise Time | < 30 seconds | Time from 10% to 90% of setpoint |
| Settling Time | < 60 seconds | Time to remain within ±2% of setpoint |
| Overshoot | < 5% | Maximum excursion beyond setpoint |
| Steady-State Error | < 0.5°C | Final deviation from setpoint |

### 3.3 Cost Function Definition

Multi-objective optimization minimized:

```matlab
J = w₁(RiseTime/30)² + w₂(Overshoot/5)² + w₃(SettlingTime/60)² + w₄(SSError/0.5)²
```

With weights w = [1, 1, 1, 1] for balanced optimization.

## 5. Error Analysis and Discussion

### 5.1 Sources of Error

1. **Model-Reality Mismatch**
   - Assumed linear dynamics (real system has nonlinearities)
   - Fixed time constants (vary with operating conditions)
   - Simplified heat transfer model (ignores radiation, conduction paths)
   - Single-point temperature measurement (spatial variations ignored)

2. **Ziegler-Nichols Limitations**
   - Method assumes S-shaped step response (not achieved)
   - Critical gain undefined for over-damped systems
   - Tangent line approximation sensitive to noise
   - 25% overshoot target inappropriate for thermal systems

3. **Optimization Constraints**
   - Conflicting objectives (speed vs. stability)
   - Local minima in cost function landscape
   - Discrete-time implementation effects ignored
   - Actuator saturation not modeled

### 5.2 Fundamental Limitation Analysis

The dominant time constant (τ₁ = 150s) creates a fundamental speed limitation:

```
Theoretical minimum rise time ≈ 2.2 × τ_dominant = 330 seconds
```

This exceeds the 30-second requirement by an order of magnitude. Achieving the specified rise time would require:
- Control gains > 100 (unfeasible)
- Control effort > 1000% (impossible)
- System redesign with faster dynamics

### 5.3 Discrepancy Analysis: Theory vs. Practice

| Parameter | Theoretical Optimal | C++ Production | Ratio | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| Kp | 9.81 | 2.50 | 3.9× | Production prioritizes stability |
| Ki | 0.15 | 0.50 | 0.3× | Higher integral for better tracking |
| Kd | 0.03 | 0.10 | 0.3× | More derivative for noise rejection |

The production values reflect:
- Real sensor noise (not modeled)
- Actuator wear considerations
- Safety margins for component protection
- Field-tested reliability over 5+ years

| Pattern Search | 68 | 301 | 401,008 | 45 seconds |
| Genetic Algorithm | 73 | 3,340 | 380,734 | 112 seconds |

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1 Key Findings

1. **Classical Methods Inadequate:** Ziegler-Nichols produced impractical gains (Kp=38.6) due to system's slow dynamics

2. **Optimization Effective but Limited:** Modern algorithms correctly identified physical constraints, converging to Kp≈10

3. **Specifications Unachievable:** The 30-second rise time requirement is physically impossible with 150-second time constants

4. **Production Values Justified:** C++ implementation (Kp=2.5, Ki=0.5, Kd=0.1) represents practical compromise between performance and reliability

5. **Model Validation Needed:** Significant discrepancy between model predictions and expected real-world behavior

### 7.2 Hypothesis Validation

| Hypothesis | Result | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| ZN provides good initial values | **Rejected** | Gains 15× too high |
| Optimization improves performance | **Confirmed** | 50% cost reduction |
| Specs are achievable | **Rejected** | Physics prevents 30s rise time |
| Theory matches practice | **Rejected** | 4× difference in gains |

### 7.3 Engineering Insights

The experiment reveals a classic engineering trade-off between:
- **Aggressive control** (fast response, high overshoot, wear)
- **Conservative control** (slow response, stable, reliable)

The production system wisely chooses conservative control, accepting slower response for:
- Component longevity
- Passenger comfort (no temperature oscillations)
- Energy efficiency (reduced cycling)
- Maintenance reduction
