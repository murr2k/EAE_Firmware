# CPPLINT configuration file for Super Linter
# Disable checks that conflict with our project structure
# - include_subdir: Our CMake setup uses different include paths
# - include_order: Our headers have dependencies that require specific ordering
# - build/c++11: We intentionally use C++11 features (threads, chrono, etc.)
# - whitespace/line_length: Allow longer lines for readability (modern monitors are wide)
