# CI/CD Workflow Failure Analysis - UPDATE

**Date:** July 31, 2025 (Updated)  
**Pipeline Run:** https://github.com/murr2k/EAE_Firmware/actions/runs/16661191023

## Current Status After Fixes

### ✅ Successfully Fixed Issues:
1. **Clang Installation** - FIXED
   - Changed from `clang-12` to `clang` (version-agnostic)
   - All clang builds now passing on both Ubuntu 24.04 and 20.04
   
2. **Static Analysis Tools** - FIXED
   - Changed to version-agnostic packages (`clang-tidy`, `clang-format`)
   - Static analysis job now passing in ~25 seconds
   
3. **Code Coverage** - FIXED
   - Added `--ignore-errors mismatch` to lcov commands
   - Coverage workflow has been passing consistently
   
4. **Python Tests** - FIXED
   - Fixed import issues in test file
   - All Python versions (3.8-3.11) now passing

5. **Markdown Linting** - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Fixed trailing punctuation in headings
   - Fixed duplicate headings
   - Added language specifiers to code blocks
   - Errors reduced from many to 5

### ❌ Remaining Issues:

1. **Security Scan (Super Linter)** - STILL FAILING
   - C++ linting errors: 14 (unchanged)
   - Markdown linting errors: 5 (reduced from many)
   - Likely due to code formatting standards not matching Super Linter defaults

2. **Sanitizer Tests** - SLOW/HANGING
   - Tests take very long or timeout
   - May need configuration adjustments

3. **Ubuntu 20.04 Builds** - SLOW
   - All ubuntu-20.04 jobs are much slower than ubuntu-latest
   - Consider removing ubuntu-20.04 from matrix if not needed

## Summary of Current Pipeline Health:
- **Passing:** 12/15 jobs (80%)
- **Failing:** 1 job (Security Scan)
- **Slow/Problematic:** 2 jobs (Sanitizer Tests, ubuntu-20.04 builds)

## Recommended Next Steps:

### Option 1: Configure Super Linter (Recommended)
Add `.github/linters/.markdown-lint.yml`:
```yaml
# Disable specific rules that are too strict in markdown
MD013: false  # Line length
MD024: false  # Multiple headers with same content
MD026: false  # Trailing punctuation in headers
```yaml

### Option 2: Disable Super Linter Temporarily
Set it to warning mode or disable until code style can be standardized.

### Option 3: Run clang-format
Run clang-format on all C++ files to match expected style.

## Previous CI/CD Workflow Failure Analysis

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Pipeline Run:** https://github.com/murr2k/EAE_Firmware/actions/runs/16660614610

## Summary of Failures

### 1. ❌ Clang-12 Installation (Ubuntu Latest)
**Issue:** Ubuntu 24.04 doesn't have clang-12 packages
**Error:** `E: Package 'clang-12' has no installation candidate`
**Solution:** Use clang-18 (default) or clang-14 through clang-19 (available)

### 2. ❌ Static Analysis Tools Installation
**Issue:** clang-tidy-12 and clang-format-12 not available in Ubuntu 24.04
**Error:** 
```text
E: Unable to locate package clang-tidy-12
E: Unable to locate package clang-format-12
```
**Solution:** Use version-agnostic packages or specify available versions

### 3. ❌ Security Scan (Super Linter)
**Issue:** Multiple linting errors found
**Errors Found:**
- C++ linting errors: 14
- Markdown linting errors: 5
- Main issues:
  - Missing language specifiers in fenced code blocks
  - Trailing spaces and punctuation in headings
  - Duplicate headings
**Solution:** Fix linting issues or configure linter to be less strict

### 4. ❌ Code Coverage
**Issue:** gcov/geninfo error with mismatched line numbers
**Error:** `geninfo: ERROR: mismatched end line for _ZN35PIDControllerTest_InitialState_Test8TestBodyEv`
**Solution:** Add ignore-errors flag or update coverage tool configuration

### 5. ⚠️ Sanitizer Tests
**Issue:** Still running/pending during analysis
**Potential Issues:** May fail due to CMake configuration with sanitizer flags

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is that the GitHub Actions runners have upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble), which has different package names and versions compared to older Ubuntu versions. The workflows were written for older Ubuntu versions with specific version-pinned packages.

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Package Names (Quick Fix)
Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
# For clang builds use
- { cc: clang, cxx: clang++ }  # Uses default clang-18
# or use
- { cc: clang-14, cxx: clang++-14 }  # Specific version

# For static analysis use
sudo apt-get install -y cppcheck clang-tidy clang-format
```bash

### Priority 2: Fix Linting Errors
1. Add language specifiers to code blocks in markdown files
2. Remove trailing punctuation from headings
3. Fix duplicate headings

### Priority 3: Fix Code Coverage
Add error suppression flags to coverage generation

## Available Ubuntu 24.04 Packages

- **Clang versions:** 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (default), 19
- **Metapackages:** `clang`, `clang-tidy`, `clang-format` (install version 18)
- **Specific versions:** `clang-14`, `clang-tidy-14`, etc.
